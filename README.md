# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters like age, cholesterol, resting ECG, and chest pain type.

## Problem Statement
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can save lives. This project uses patient health data to classify whether or not a person is likely to have heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting ECG
- ST Depression
- Exercise-Induced Angina

> **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

> **Best Accuracy Achieved**: `86.11%` using **Random Forest**

## Project Steps
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned missing values and encoded categorical data
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Built and evaluated multiple classification models
5. Compared accuracies and confusion matrices

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `PRCP-1016-HeartDiseasePred.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells step-by-step

##  Result
The Random Forest model gave the best result with high accuracy and balanced classification performance.
